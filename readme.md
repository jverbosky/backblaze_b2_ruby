**Backblaze B2 API - Ruby Methods**

I based these off of the API docs located here:
[https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/)

Although these were a great start, there were still a number of items that I needed to work out.

The "wrapper methods" are B2 versions of methods that I wrote for working with AWS S3 in my Portfolio repo.

For an integrated example, please see this file from my Portfolio repo:
[https://github.com/jverbosky/portfolio/blob/master/lib/b2_bucket.rb](https://github.com/jverbosky/portfolio/blob/master/lib/b2_bucket.rb)

Have fun and hope that helps!
